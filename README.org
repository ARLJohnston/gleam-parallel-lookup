* Parallel Lookup
This program takes in a url (e.g. `gleam.run`) and creates threads for each address the website has (both IPv4 and IPv6 if they exist).

After all addresses have been discovered a thread is spawned for each address, each thread attempts to get the page content.

The first thread that returns the page content `wins` and presents the page to stdout, thus choosing the fastest address.

** How to run

```sh
gleam run gleam.run
```
